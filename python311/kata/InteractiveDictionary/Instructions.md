# Interactive Dictionary

In this kata, your job is to create a class Dictionary which you can add words to and their entries. Example:
```py
>>> d = Dictionary()

>>> d.newentry('Apple', 'A fruit that grows on trees')

>>> print(d.look('Apple'))
A fruit that grows on trees

>>> print(d.look('Banana'))
Can't find entry for Banana
```
Good luck and happy coding!
